Write a C program that will read in a sentence and print it vertically. The program will prompt for a string. The program will output the string, in reverse order it was entered, and arranged vertically such that it is read from bottom to top. There should be one space between each word printed. Convert strings to all uppercase. Use at least one user-defined function in the program. Refer to the sample output below.
